**Kura Zetu** is an open source platform with mobile application built by and for Kenyans to enable communities to track, verify, and tally election results at the polling station level.

Since every Kenyan voter has access to a smartphone and results announced at polling stations are legally final, citizens can serve as agents of electoral transparency. The platform implements crowd-sourced uploads, real-time tallies, and a community verification system that allows everyday citizens, developers, journalists, civil society organizations, and oversight bodies to participate in safeguarding electoral integrity from the ground up.

The system is designed as an open source, community-driven project where anyone can contribute, verify, and improve the codebase.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is not an official tallying system. It does not provide legal representation of election results and does not replace Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) systems. This is a parallel citizen-led tool for transparency, verification, and civic vigilance. It may contain inaccuracies and gaps and should not be used as a sole source for official election results.

## Why Kura Zetu?

Kenya conducts elections in over 46,000 polling stations. Each station posts Form 34A results that carry legal weight, but verifying these results at scale (and self-tallying) remains challenging for citizens.

Kura Zetu addresses this challenge by:

- Crowdsourcing results from individual polling stations
- Enabling public cross-verification of vote counts and irregularity flagging  
- Providing live, transparent tally dashboards
- Implementing a community notes system for flagging suspected fraud, misinformation, or conflicting results
